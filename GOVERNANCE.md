# TerminaI Governance

This document outlines how the TerminaI project is governed, how decisions are
made, and how contributors can become maintainers.

## Leadership Projects

TerminaI follows a **Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)** model.

**Project Lead:** Prof Harita (The "BDFL")

The Project Lead has final say over:

- Technical direction and roadmap
- Release schedule
- Merge privileges
- Governance policy changes

## Maintainers

Maintainers are community members who have shown consistent commitment and
alignment with the project's vision. They are granted write access to the
repository.

### Responsibilities

- Triage issues and PRs.
- Merge pull requests that pass the
  [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Enforce the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainership is by invitation only. The best way to be invited is to:

1.  Consistently contribute high-quality code.
2.  Help others in issues and discussions.
3.  Demonstrate "Goal Alignment" (see `README.md`).

## Decision Making

1.  **Consensus Seeking**: We aim for consensus on technical decisions within
    issues and PRs.
2.  **Lead Decision**: If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Lead will
    make the final decision to prevent deadlock.

## Modifications

This governance document may be amended at any time by the Project Lead.
